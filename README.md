# AI-based-Smart-Attendance-System-
Face recognition systems can be used to identify people in photos,videos or in real-time . The attendance system will track employee location , time of clocking/out, and the report recorded. The attendance system will then process the data, to produce timesheet reports, absence reports, task and request reports

## Support Vector Machine - SVM 
- Support vector machines(SVMs) are powerful yet flexiblle supervised machine learning algorithms which are used for both classification and regression.
- The goal of SVM is to divide the datasets into classes to find a maximum marginal hyperplane(MMH)
- Support Vectors - Datapoints that are closet to the hyperplane is called support vectors.Separating line will be defined with the help of these data points.
- Hyperplane - It is a decision plane or space which is divided between a set of objects having different classes.
